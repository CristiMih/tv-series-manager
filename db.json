When he is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, he considers what will happen to his family when he dies.<br /><br />In a raid by the Anti-narcotics Police organized by Walter's brother-in-law, Henry Navarro, he recognizes a former student of his, José Miguel Rosas, whom he contacts to manufacture and sell methamphetamine and thus ensure the economic well-being of his family. But the approach to the world of drugs and the dealings with traffickers and mafiosi contaminates the personality of Walter, who gradually abandons his straight and predictable personality to become someone without too many scruples when it comes to getting what he wants.</p>",
